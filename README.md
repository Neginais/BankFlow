# BankFlow
BankFlow is a Python-based banking and loan management system designed to simulate essential banking operations and simplify the loan application process. Users can perform deposits, withdrawals, and check their account balance seamlessly.

The system allows users to request loans by specifying the desired amount and repayment period. It evaluates requests against predefined loan plans based on the userâ€™s current balance and credit score, then recommends the best match. Monthly payments are calculated using amortization formulas to ensure transparency.

Once confirmed, BankFlow generates a detailed loan agreement outlining the terms, interest rate, payment schedule, and borrower responsibilities. The program supports multiple loan applications with options to retry or exit, providing an interactive, user-friendly console experience.

Built with object-oriented programming, BankFlow offers a practical introduction to banking workflows, credit assessment, and loan processing in a clean and modular design.
